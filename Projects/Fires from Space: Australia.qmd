**Class Rank:** 🏆 Top 1% | **Role:** Data Analyst & Geospatial Modeler 


## 🌍 The Mission
**From the sky to the ground, we visualize risk.**

Using advanced satellite telemetry and geospatial analysis, **Fire Storm** explores the patterns and intensity of the devastating "Black Summer" wildfires across Australia. We move beyond simple fire counts to reveal how manageable fires escalated into uncontrollable events, offering critical insights into climate change, land use, and disaster preparedness.

> *“We visualize where fires are burning and what they reveal about the air we breathe and the land we use.”*

## 📊 The Analysis
*Explaining the crisis through data.*

### 🛰️ 01. The View from Space
We processed **240+ days** of continuous satellite imagery. By analyzing heat signatures over time, we tracked not just the location, but the **velocity and intensity** of the fire spread across the continent.

### 📈 02. The "Black Summer" Escalation
Our models identified the precise moments where fire intensity spiked.

* **Key Finding:** We uncovered specific correlation patterns between high-intensity heat clusters and rapid, hazardous declines in air quality.

### 🏘️ 03. Ground-Level Impact
It isn't just about the burns; it's about the aftermath.

* **Air Quality:** Visualized the drift of toxic smoke plumes into major urban centers.

* **Land Use:** Overlaid fire paths with agricultural and residential zoning to assess economic and social vulnerability.
