## 🌐 The Mission
**If work has changed, shouldn't the workplace change too?**

The "Return to Office" isn't just about *when*—it's about *where*. Using a massive dataset of commercial leases from 2018 to 2024, this project investigates how the COVID-19 pandemic fundamentally altered the DNA of the office market. We answer the critical question: *Are companies actually abandoning the city, or are they just upgrading their address?* 

> *We analyzed the shift in square footage to prove that the future of work isn't remote—it's hybrid, high-quality, and geographically flexible.*

## 🏙️ The Analysis
*Tracking the migration of capital and companies.*

### 01. The "Flight to Quality"
**Class A vs. Class O**
We tracked lease volumes across building classes. The data revealed a decisive split:

* **Pre-Pandemic:** Major leases were roughly split, with Class A holding ~65% of the market.

* **The Shift:** Post-COVID, the share of Class A (premium) leases surged to over **70%**. Companies are downsizing footprint but upgrading quality to entice workers back.

### 🏡 02. The Suburban Surge
**CBD vs. The Burbs**
We analyzed the tension between Central Business Districts (CBD) and Suburban locations.

* **The Shock:** During the height of the pandemic (2020), suburban leasing spiked to **60%**, overtaking downtowns.

* **The Recovery:** Post-2022, the market began correcting. CBD leasing is recovering, signaling a return to equilibrium rather than the "death of the city".

### 🗺️ 03. The Strategy
**The "Hybrid" Portfolio**
Based on the data, we formulated a site selection strategy for 2025:

* **Blend Locations:** Maintain a core CBD presence for prestige while opening suburban satellites for flexibility.

* **Reposition Assets:** Investors holding lower-quality (Class O) stock must renovate immediately to survive.
