## 📚 The Mission
**Grades aren't just about IQ. They're about habits.**

We often blame academic struggles on external factors like funding or background. But what if the secret to success lies in the small, daily choices we make?
Using a dataset of **1,000 students**, this project applies behavioral analysis and predictive modeling to answer a simple question: *How do sleep, screen time, and study routines mathematically determine your GPA?*

> *We moved beyond intuition to quantify exactly how much an hour of Netflix costs you in exam points.*

## 📉 The Analysis
*Decoding the student lifestyle.*

### 01. The Hypothesis
**The "Hidden" Variables**
Most research focuses on fixed demographics. We flipped the script to focus on **controllable behaviors**.

* **Input:** Sleep hours, study duration, attendance, social media usage, and Netflix consumption.

* **Target:** Final Academic Performance (Exam Score).

### 🧮 02. The Model
**Stepwise Precision**
We didn't just look for correlations; we built a prediction engine. Using **Stepwise Multiple Regression**, we isolated the variables that actually move the needle.

* **Performance:** The final model achieved an **Adjusted $R^2 \approx 0.90$**, meaning we could explain nearly 90% of the variance in exam scores based purely on lifestyle habits.

### 📊 03. The Visualization
**Seeing the Trade-offs**
We created a visual ecosystem to make the data digestible:
* **Correlation Heatmaps:** Instantly highlighting the strongest positive (Study Time) and negative (Screen Time) drivers.

* **Comparative Bar Charts:** contrasting high-performing vs. at-risk student profiles.

## 🔍 Key Findings
*The data-backed recipe for an A+.*

* **The Attendance Multiplier:** Attendance wasn't just helpful; it was the single strongest predictor of success.

* **The "Binge" Tax:** Passive screen time (Netflix/Social Media) showed a quantifiable negative correlation with exam scores—every hour spent binging had a measurable grade penalty.

* **Sleep is Study:** Contrary to the "all-nighter" culture, data confirmed that adequate sleep is statistically linked to higher performance.
