## 💤 The Mission
**How does our daily grind affect our nightly rest?**

We spend roughly one-third of our lives asleep, yet the factors determining the *quantity* of that sleep remain complex. Using the **Kaggle Sleep Health & Lifestyle dataset**, this project applies rigorous statistical modeling to quantify how age, physical activity, and stress interact to determine sleep duration.

> *We moved beyond simple correlations to build a robust predictive model, identifying exactly which lifestyle changes yield the best returns on rest.*

## 📉 The Analysis
*From raw data to refined insight.*

### 01. The Baseline Challenge
**Diagnosing the Model**
Our initial exploration revealed significant relationships, but the raw data violated key regression assumptions. Diagnostic plots highlighted **non-linearity** and **heteroscedasticity** (uneven variance), meaning a standard linear model was insufficient for accurate prediction.

### 🛠️ 02. Engineering the Solution
**Transformation & Optimization**
To address these structural issues, we engineered features using **Power Transformations (bcPower)** to normalize predictors like Age, Stress, and Activity.

* **Variable Selection:** We utilized **Stepwise Regression (AIC)** to strip away noise, isolating only the most statistically significant predictors.

### 🧩 03. The Final Model
**Precision Tuning**
The optimized model achieved an **Adjusted $R^2 \approx 0.83$**, explaining 83% of the variance in sleep duration.

* **Outcome:** Residual errors were minimized to 0.046, creating a highly reliable framework for predicting sleep outcomes.

## 🔍 Key Findings
*What the data says about sleeping better.*

* **Quality Equals Quantity:** Sleep quality was the strongest positive predictor—better sleep depth significantly correlates with longer duration.

* **Move to Snooze:** Physical activity levels showed a strong positive correlation with sleep duration.

* **The Age Factor:** Interestingly, age showed a slight negative correlation; as we get older, sleep duration tends to decrease marginally (-0.02% per unit increase).

* **The "Daily Steps" Paradox:** While general physical activity is good, raw "Daily Steps" showed a negligible or slightly negative impact, suggesting that *intensity* of exercise matters more than just step count
