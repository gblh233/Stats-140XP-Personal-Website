Companies are downsizing footprint but upgrading quality to entice workers back.\n\n\n\n🏡 02. The Suburban Surge\nCBD vs. The Burbs We analyzed the tension between Central Business Districts (CBD) and Suburban locations.\n\nThe Shock: During the height of the pandemic (2020), suburban leasing spiked to 60%, overtaking downtowns.\nThe Recovery: Post-2022, the market began correcting. CBD leasing is recovering, signaling a return to equilibrium rather than the “death of the city”.\n\n\n\n🗺️ 03. The Strategy\nThe “Hybrid” Portfolio Based on the data, we formulated a site selection strategy for 2025:\n\nBlend Locations: Maintain a core CBD presence for prestige while opening suburban satellites for flexibility.\nReposition Assets: Investors holding lower-quality (Class O) stock must renovate immediately to survive."
