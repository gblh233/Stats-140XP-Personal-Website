Collaborative, fast-learning Data Science major with strong communication and a bias for action. I thrive in cross-functional teams, take initiative, and adapt quickly to new challenges. Comfortable moving from data wrangling and analysis to modeling and lightweight pipelines, I use Python/R to convert messy data into clear insights and reproducible workflows. Spring 2026 and subsequent work in Data Science, Data Analytics, or Data Engineering to contribute immediately and deliver measurable value.
